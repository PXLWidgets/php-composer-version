## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.0] (2019-07-26)

### Added
- CLI option `-m, --message` to override the commit message content for a version commit.
  Sequences of `%s` within a given message are replaced with the new version number.

## [1.2.2] (2019-07-19)

### Fixed
- Now only adds touched files to Git stage before version commit, whereas before
  the entire working copy was committed when the option **allow dirty** was toggled, 
  and there were unstaged changes. 

## [1.2.1] (2019-07-19)

### Fixed
- Missing CLI option documentation for `--set-version`

## [1.2.0] (2019-07-19)

### Added
- Branch existence check for branch names provided with `--branch`
- CLI option `-V, --set-version <version>` for providing a version as CLI argument.

### Fixed

### Added

- CLI option for displaying CLI help page. 
- CLI option for displaying php-composer-version version number. 
- CLI option to allow operating on a dirty working directory
    > When set, additional project changes may exist when running php-composer-version.

- CLI option to toggle also updating the version in `package.json`
    > As of this release disabled by default - see 'Changed'
- Add CLI help page

### Changed
- Sync of version in package.json is now omitted by default
    > This allows users to do a global installation of this package, so that the PHP package 
under development does not have to have a `package.json` file in the repository.

### Added
- Prompt for new version number
